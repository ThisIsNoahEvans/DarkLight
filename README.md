# DarkLight
A simple macOS menu bar icon to change the system theme, made with 100% Swift

## Latest release: Version 1.0
Version 1.0 - download on our [website](https://velocityapps.tech/darklight) or from our [GitHub Release](https://github.com/VelocityApps/DarkLight/releases/tag/1.0)

Alternatively, you can clone this repo and compile the app yourself. The 'App' folder and project contains the app that sits on your menu bar and the 'Helper' folder contains the required helper tool. The helper tool must be installed to ~/.DarkLight with the same name unless you change the main app code. You will also need to add the .plist to /Library/LaunchAgents for the app to install automatically when you log in. Or....you could just download and run the [.pkg](https://github.com/VelocityApps/DarkLight/releases/tag/1.0) and have all of this done for you :)

## Why isn't this on the Mac App Store?
We like distributing apps through Apple's app stores, however part of how this application works is blocked by the Mac App Store. We know this is a pain, but unfortunately is unavoidable.
