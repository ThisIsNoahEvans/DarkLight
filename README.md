A simple macOS application and menu bar icon to change the system theme

## Latest release: Version 1.0, coming soon
We're just ironing out a few bugs we found last minute. You can download and compile the project yourself, but if you'd like a ready-made installer, then come back in a few days. Follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/velocityappshq) or watch this repo for updates.

## Why isn't this on the Mac App Store?
We like distributing apps through Apple's app stores, however part of how this application works is blocked by the Mac App Store. We know this is a pain, but unfortunately is unavoidable.
