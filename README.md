# DarkLight Mode
A simple macOS application and menu bar icon to change the system theme

## Latest release: [Version 1.0](https://github.com/VelocityApps/DarkLightMode/releases/tag/1.0)

## Why isn't this on the Mac App Store?
We like distributing apps through Apple's app stores, however part of how this application works is blocked by the Mac App Store. We know this is a pain, but unfortunately is unavoidable.
